#summary Java program to control SDK Flex Compiler

MBCompiler is a small Java console program that receives commands from MiniBuilder and hand them over to Flex SDK. It also helps MiniBuilder run some native system commands.

In order to be able to compile ActionScript projects with MiniBuilder, you need to have the MBCompiler console running. You also may want to take a look at the traces.

You can make a handy shortcut to the startup batch/shell script.

The program is made so if you start it twice, the old instance will be stopped and only the new one will run. This is also a simple way to restart it.

When you restart the compiler, all incremental compilations will be reset. You can use this to quickly force a clean compilation.
