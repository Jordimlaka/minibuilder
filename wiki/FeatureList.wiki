MiniBuilder is addictive!
Once you get a grasp on it, it's hard to switch back to other editors.

*** Works on Linux and Windows
*** It's Free and Open Source
*** Although not the fastest thing on Earth, you'll be surprised that
code completion is _always_ there in time when you need it.

**** AS3 Code Highlight and Code Completion:
- parses code _as you type_ and recognizes your code structure
- parses SWC and SWF libraries and adds typeinfo for code completion

- Special code completion helpers:
regexp constants, string constants, cast expressions are hinted (examples)

- code highlight is context sensitive, it is based on the same grammar engine as the completion.

**** Organizing
You can place your projects wherever you want on your disk and you are free to move the project
folder without breaking anything

*** Flex SDK Compiler integration. Friendly display of errors and warnings, one-click open file and goto error line
also, the errors are hinted as tooltips on the left editor bar
