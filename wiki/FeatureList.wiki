#summary Program description and feature list

 * It's lightweight (smaller than 3MB download)
 * Works on Linux and Windows
 * It's Free and Open Source
 * May be not the fastest thing on Earth but you'll be surprised that
code completion is there _in time_ when you need it.

== Features ==

=== AS3 Code Highlight and Code Completion ===
 * parses code _as you type_ and recognizes your code structure
 * parses SWC and SWF libraries and adds typeinfo for code completion


 * Special code completion helpers:
  * regexp literals `/myregexp/.test(str)`
  * string literals `"str1,str2,str3".split(',')`
  * cast expressions `(value as MyClass).myClassMethod()` and `MyClass(value).myClassMethod()`

Code highlight is context sensitive, it is based on the same grammar engine as the completion.
