===Setup !MiniBuilder on Flex (Flash) Builder===


  # Make sure you have SVN in your Eclipse/Flex http://subclipse.tigris.org/servlets/ProjectProcess?pageID=p4wYuA
  # Create a new workspace File->Switch Workspace->Other (eg /home/user/workspace-mb)
  # File->New->Other -> SVN -> Checkout project from SVN, new repo: http://minibuilder.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/
  # List contents of trunk, select !AirMiniBuilder and click Finish
  # Similarly, get the project !ScriptArea
  # set sdk 3.4 or higher to both projects (download a sdk if needed)
  # you might need to manualy edit .actionScriptProperties. set htmlPlayerVersion="10.0.0" in compiler node
  # Clean compile !AirMiniBuilder.
  # download and extract a new air sdk from http://www.adobe.com/products/air/tools/sdk/ eg in /home/user/downloads/Flex/AdobeAIRSDK
  # Flex alpha has issues with running apps for air 1.5, but you can run the app in debug mode (a mode that shows exception popups) using adl:
{{{
cd /home/user/downloads/Flex/AdobeAIRSDK/bin/
chmod +x adl
./adl /home/user/workspace-mb/AirMiniBuilder/bin-debug/AirMiniBuilder-app.xml
}}}

==Setup for !MiniBuider:==

  # install minibuilder
  # get a new air sdk from http://www.adobe.com/products/air/tools/sdk/ and extract it on your drive
  # get svn and minibuilder sources
{{{
apt-get install subversion
svn co http://minibuilder.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/
mv trunk workspace-mb
}}}
  # open installed minibuilder and open project !AirMiniBuilder from workspace-mb
  # make desired changes to the source
  # compile
  # run airminibuilder in debug mode using adl from the new air sdk
{{{
cd AdobeAIRSDK/bin/
chmod +x adl
./adl /path/to/AirMiniBuilder/bin-debug/AirMiniBuilder-app.xml
}}}

Use debugger console to see the inside story ;)
